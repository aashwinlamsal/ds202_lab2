## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

1. How are ratings distributed?
The distribution of the ratings for the different chocolates has somewhat of a bell-curve shape, with most of the ratings being between 3 and 3.5, with outliers on both ends of the bell-curve distribution.

```{r choco}
hist(choco$Rating)
boxplot(choco$Rating)
```

2. Do ratings depend on the cacao percentage of the chocolate bar?
Based on the distriubtions below, there doesn't seem to be any kind of correlation between the percentage of cocoa and the rating of the chocolate bars, with t
```{r choco}
boxplot(choco$Rating~choco$Cocoa.Pct)
plot(choco$Rating~choco$Cocoa.Pct)
```
